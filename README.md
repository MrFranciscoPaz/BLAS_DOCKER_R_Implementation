# BLAS_DOCKER_R_Implementation

This repository contains a docker container which shows the differences in performance using the standard Basic Linear Algebra System (BLAS) and two optimized implementations: OpenBLAS (version 0.3.5+ds-2)and ATLAS (version 3.10.1-4).

We use a docker image of a Debian 9 distribution with the 4.15.0-46-generic kernel. The tests are run using R version 3.5.1. To measure performance, you can run two different performance tests: the R Benchmark 2.5, by Simon Urbanek (2008), and the Algebraic Packages Benchmark 1.0, by Dante Ruiz and Laura LÃ³pez (2019).

To build the docker and run the performance tests, you need to clone this repository and run the following commands:

```shell
docker build -t r-performance .
docker run --rm -i -t -v my/repository/folder:/home/performance r-performance /bin/bash
```
If everything goes well, you will start in the bash system of the newly created docker image. Then, you can run the performance tests with the command:

```shell
test --option
```

The available options are:
* `--standard` to run the test using the default BLAS system.
* `--openblas` to run the test using the optimized OpenBLAS system.
* `--atlas` to run the test using the optimized ATLAS system.
* `--all` to run the test using all systems.
* `--all_graphic` to run the test using all systems and displaying a graphical comparison.
* `--help` to get more detailed descriptions of the commands.
