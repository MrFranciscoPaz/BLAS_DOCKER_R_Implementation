Runs one of two possible tests for matrix operations in R version 3.5.1 in order
to test the performance of different Basic Linear Algebra System (BLAS) 
packages.
The results of the tests are displayed on the terminal screen.

The available arguments are:'
   -t		performance test to run. The two tests available are Urbanek's 
		R Benchmark 2.5 ('urbanek' or 'u') and LÃ³pez and Ruiz Algebraic 
		Packages Benchmark ('lr' or 'lopez-ruiz').
   -m		package used to run the performance test. Available options are
		the default libblas package ('s' or 'standard'), the optimized 
		libopenblas package ('o' or 'open') and the optimized libatlas3 
		package ('a' or 'atlas'). You can also run all available tests 
		('all') and make a graph with the performance of all tests 
		('graph').
   -h		Shows this document.
